💻 Usage
Quick Start (Jupyter Notebook)

Clone the repository

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-kaggle-solution.git
cd titanic-kaggle-solution

Place data files

bash# Download from Kaggle and place in data/ directory
# Or update paths in the notebook

Run the notebook

bashjupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_solution.ipynb
Step-by-Step Execution
1. Load Data
pythonimport pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

# Load datasets
train = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('data/test.csv')
test_ids = test['PassengerId'].copy()
2. Feature Engineering
pythondef engineer_features(df):
    """Create advanced features from raw data"""
    df = df.copy()
    
    # Name features
    df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\.', expand=False)
    df['Name_Length'] = df['Name'].str.len()
    
    # Cabin features
    df['Cabin_Deck'] = df['Cabin'].str[0]
    df['Has_Cabin'] = df['Cabin'].notna().astype(int)
    
    # Ticket features
    df['Ticket_Prefix'] = df['Ticket'].str.split().str[0]
    ticket_counts = df['Ticket'].value_counts()
    df['Ticket_Frequency'] = df['Ticket'].map(ticket_counts)
    
    # Family features
    df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1
    df['IsAlone'] = (df['FamilySize'] == 1).astype(int)
    
    # ... (see full code in notebook)
    
    return df

train_fe = engineer_features(train)
test_fe = engineer_features(test)
3. Train Models
python# Setup models
models = {
    'CatBoost': CatBoostClassifier(
        iterations=500,
        learning_rate=0.03,
        depth=6,
        random_state=42,
        verbose=False
    ),
    # ... other models
}

# Cross-validation
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy')
    print(f"{name}: {scores.mean():.4f} (+/- {scores.std():.4f})")
4. Generate Submission
python# Train best model on full training set
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = best_model.predict(X_test)

# Create submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'PassengerId': test_ids,
    'Survived': predictions
})
submission.to_csv('submissions/titanic_submission.csv', index=False)
🔬 Feature Engineering
Name Analysis
The Name column contains valuable information:

Titles: Mr (adult male), Mrs (married woman), Miss (unmarried woman), Master (boy), rare titles (Dr, Rev, etc.)
Social Status: Name length often correlates with social standing
Family Groups: Surnames help identify families traveling together

Example:
"Braund, Mr. Owen Harris" → Title: Mr, Surname: Braund, Length: 23
Cabin Intelligence
The Cabin column reveals:

Deck Location: First letter (A-G, T) indicates deck level

Higher decks (A, B, C) = wealthier passengers = better survival


Cabin Availability: Having cabin info suggests higher class
Multiple Cabins: Some passengers booked multiple rooms

Example:
"C85" → Deck: C, Has_Cabin: 1, Cabin_Count: 1
"C23 C25 C27" → Deck: C, Has_Cabin: 1, Cabin_Count: 3
Ticket Patterns
The Ticket column shows:

Prefixes: Indicate ticket types or booking agencies

"PC" = Paris, "SOTON/O.Q." = Southampton


Shared Tickets: Groups traveling together
Ticket Frequency: Helps identify families and groups

Example:
"PC 17599" → Prefix: PC, Frequency: 1
"347082" → Prefix: Numeric, Frequency: 7 (large group)

Why CatBoost?
CatBoost excels in this competition because:

Native Categorical Handling: No need for extensive encoding
Robust to Overfitting: Built-in regularization
Missing Value Support: Handles NaN values naturally
Minimal Tuning Required: Good defaults out of the box
Fast Training: Efficient GPU support

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)
pythonfrom catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'iterations': [300, 500, 700],
    'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.03, 0.05],
    'depth': [4, 6, 8],
    'l2_leaf_reg': [1, 3, 5]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    CatBoostClassifier(random_state=42, verbose=False),
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='accuracy',
    n_jobs=-1
)

grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best params: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best score: {grid_search.best_score_:.4f}")
